#### Module 2 Lesson 2 (Part 2): Implementing and managing virtual networks with Azure PowerShell & CLI

In this lesson, as a continuation of the previous lesson, I get into details of Azure Virtual Networks and how to implement them in Azure PowerShell and CLI 2.0. I will be primarily using Visual Studio Code as my editor and Azure Cloud Shell to run the PowerShell and CLI commands. Watch my previous module (link below in description) to get started with Azure PowerShell and CLI. Like the previous lesson, this is a jam-packed lesson with loads of hands-on stuff. After explaining some concepts, we go hands-on in building an actual Azure virtual network with two subnets through the Azure PowerShell and Azure CLI. As a bonus I also show how to create virtual machines in Azure PowerShell and CLI.
